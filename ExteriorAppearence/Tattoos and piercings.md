#Introduction
This is about what the human mind and society perceive as the ink on the body. 
I'll talk also about piercings, they've been used by the gay community as a tag, a symbol to be different.
Although shall we accept as society all the body modifications? Like a split tongue or plastic implants to grow horns.

##Piercings in general  

The piercing in the society has been now widely spread accepted. The piercing is any metal/plastic object in sites different than
the lower ear lobe. Although here in this paragraphs I underwent a general description. Piercing can be of many kinds,
from a simple nose piercing, a septum piercing or even a dimple piercing. The earring is more accepted, while a septum piercing is not,
already this difference is kind of strange. So where do we start to identify a piercing as overdone? As non social acceptable?

Piercings were used in the past as a recognition elements. For example the value of the ear ring was determining in which social
status you would belong. With the increased medical health measure wilder piercing became possible.
The piercing or earring can cause infections, or even cause death if the infection goes untreated.
However with the new techniques in medicine one can explore piercings in other part of the body.
Not only on the head, but all over the body. A piercing on a man is less accepted till today, although a ear ring or a eyebrow piercing
can increase the sex appeal. In the 70ies the piercing was used to be a recognition for gay people.
For example a piercing (like Elton John) on the right ear lobe shows the alternative sexual orientation.

A piercing can be used also sexually, genital piercings are used to increase the orgasm. 
Not only penis piercing, but also vaginal or on the nipples. Sexual play with piercing should be more exciting. 
I'm personally completely in favor to this modifications. If somebody would disagree, I'd love to hear the motivations.

##The tongue piercing

The tongue piercing, fairly easy to hide, can be sexy and discrete. Is a tongue piercing attractive? what is exactly attractiveness
in our society? How do we measure it? Is the piercing sexy because is hidden? Is the piercing helping in oral sexual activities? 
I think that answering these questions is critical to understand the piercing in our society.
The piercing itself can be attractive for some people, other will find it disgusting. The fact that while speaking normally
is not visible, helps those people who can't stand this piercing to accept it.

##The stretching

Piercings that dilate the wound to form a larger implant. Also called gauge piercing. The stretching can be acceptable,
but many forms of it are regarded as disgusting from the rest of society. They are used in some tribal African cultures.
How do we decide as a society what is acceptable in an absolute matter. The girl in the picture has the ear stretched although
she appears as not only acceptable but also hot. This type of piercing can be socially acceptable.
A group of people can accept this type of body modification without problems. Can the whole human society?
Where do we trace the threshold? How do we define acceptability?

Moreover there's piercings that are done in order to shock people and to show some kind of rebellion to the society standard.
This kind of piercing is difficult to integrate in a acceptability context. 

Somehow ears stretching piercing are better visually. Although this has probably strong cultural influence.
So how do we define a socially acceptable law that will comprise which piercings are good or not and in which case?
