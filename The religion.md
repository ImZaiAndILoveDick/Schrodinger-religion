#The religion
This file will contain the body of the religion itself. How it should be construtcted or how should be conceived.

##What is a religion?
>"Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation
> that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called "an order of existence"."
> Wikipedia [1] 

This religion wants to be a way of achieving coexistence in the human specie, and to promote progress,
we will later define what is meant by progress and coexistence in detail, but both terms are to be taken in the literal form.
Progress[2]: Development towards an improved or more advanced condition. 
Coexistence[3]: he state or condition of living in harmony despite different ideologies or interests.

## Why the need of a new religion
The main religions right now are based on old texts. Christianity has the biblical canon, namely the new and old testament [1],
Islam has the Qua'ran [2], Hinduism have Vedas and the Upanishads, although defining the texts as fundamental of the religion
is incomplete, due to the diverse traditions of Hinduism [3]. Buddhist have like the Hinduism a variety of texts that for some
are considered as sacred and for others no [4]. Although all in all this texts are in general written in antiquity
and don't take in account the fast pace of progression that the recent times have undergo.

[[4] wikipedia - Buddhist scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Buddhist_texts)

The modern religions albeit trying to adapt toward the new era by reinterpreting the same scripts commit
a huge fallacy in reusing the old conception to try to fit them in the new concepts.
This is also the reason of the faith decay in the new century. The wild reinterpretation creates paradoxes
and splits into subgroups. Although they are updated continuously by the work of the religious leaders this creates
a fragmentation and an ad hoc religion which doesn't really reflect anymore the original branch. 

Thus the identity of a religion fragments in many subgroups. 
Christianity is divided in three main groups, Roman catholicism, Protestants and Eastern Orthodoxy.
Muslims seems to convey that the faith is more unitary, and they recognize themselves as part of something called ummah,
which contains all the faucets of faith. Although this unity there are also subgroups like the Sunni and Shi'a,
but also spawns from the religion like Wahhabi Islam or Nation of Islam. 
Howard R. Greenstein takes the words from Leo Trepp and identifies six subgroups in Judaism. [1]
I'm sure that also the other major religions in the world have such a fragmentation.
Hinduism and Buddhism are already a convolution of many traditions and rites. [2]

##How is the new religion different
I want to create a modern religion, written socially by people, which can also be a group, or even anonymous.
I want to create a dynamic sacred script that modifies by the discovery of new technologies.
I want a population contribution, for writing a text for humans written by humans.
I don't want to refuse completely the old and sacred text, because I'm sure they contain deep fundamentals of the human nature. 

##Satanism and the new religion
Something that will go toward LaVey said.
Laveyian stanism is an atheist religion, that promote the individualism and social darwinism. [1]
Albeit the idea of an atheist religion is very good, I don't find useful to completely refuse deities,
since the majority of the population has the need of a supernatural being.
Also the culture of individualism and the culture of the human instincts is actually very good,
as long as is used to facilitate the interaction with other humans. 
An anthropocentric view of the religion itself is a basic in the new religion.
Although is human to desire a deity or desire a collective consciousness.
This feelings must be considered when creating this dual religion. 
However in this religion is also accepted whom might have refused completely the presence of a deity.

##Why don't we consider a Schrödinger religion?  
Schrödinger religion, will actually consider the hypothesis that atheism AND theism both exist at the same time.
The existence of god discussion is matematically proven to be a non answerable question,
since neither part as far as of now can provide proof. (Revise this! source, Gödel and Sobel).
Although is a human need to believe in a super being, a order of things, a god or gods so to say.
More than 80% of the population believes or is unsure about the presence of a god. [1]
This reflects a basic human need to cope with the apparent meaning void life. Now god, or a super natural being,
is anyhow a human mental construct. Something the brain creates, something humans conceive and worship. 
Now how can we make a religion that will encompass both ends? A Schrödinger religion?
A religion that both considers the existense and non existence of deity?
